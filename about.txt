utism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder[19] that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without remission.[20] Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years,[21] and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.[22] It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.[23] Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits
